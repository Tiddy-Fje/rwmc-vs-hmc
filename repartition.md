## To do :
* redact theoretical results 
  * can keep them in the same section with theory 
  * do we include the failed rejection sampling in the appendix ?? 
  * included well commented sampler in appendex
    * just comment a bit more 
* analysis of (d) (as function of algorithm and params) 
  * in terms of KL distance
    * as function of params of interest
    * continue checking for best params
      * can plot best RW as line in HMC plots
      * could show plot as function of sample size (for best parameters)
      * give best values to Aude for ACF/ESS analysis   
  * in terms of ESS -> Aude does it
